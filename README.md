## Hi there my name is Stella and I am a Physicist playing with AI and Bioinformatics!
    
I began my academic journey in Physics 🪐 at the department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from which I graduated in 2019 and in 2021 got my MSc in Digital Media and Computational Intelligence 👩‍💻 from the department of Informatics. 
    
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Biology 🧬 at the department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) under the supervision of Andreas Agathangelidis and also working as a research fellow at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) in the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) under the supervision of Fotis Psomopoulos. 
    
I am also keen on photography, plants and I have two cats named Milko & Mo :)
